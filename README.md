# Black hole mass estimation in type II AGN

This repository contains the data that was presented in the paper by Baron & Ménard (2019; https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01996).
The repository consists of a jupyter notebook that loads the data and explores it. 
In addition, the repository contains a python code to estimate the black hole mass of type II AGN, using the narrow Halpha, Hbeta, and [OIII] emission line fluxes.
